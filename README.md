This application has been developed as part of
the [*Prenez Place !*](https://github.com/Prenez-Place/Face-B-Blockchain-module)
project, and is based on the [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate).

During performances, it helps to record debates, output some audio mixes using past debate fragments,
and automatically create NFTs of entire debates and fragments of debates.
